    <h1>Ease please?</h1>
</header>

<p>This LESS mix-in is designed to apply an easing pattern to traditionally arbitrary styling groups such as text size, fills,
    box sizes, etc. The mix-in accepts the following parameters.</p>
<dl>
    
        <dt>interpolation</dt>
        <dd>ease-in, ease-out, ease-inout</dd>
    
        <dt>power</dt>
        <dd>1-5</dd>
    
        <dt>input</dt>
        <dd>A number (or unit) between 0 and 1 or less than &#x27;compare&#x27;</dd>
    
        <dt>compare</dt>
        <dd>(Optional) A number or unit, eg. 100%</dd>
    
</dl>
<p>The following examples use 12 points evenly plotted between 5%
    and 100%. The group of points is first passed through 1:1, then interpolated with ease.</p>
